//getServerSession comes from NextAuth.js and is used in Next.js App Router or API routes to fetch the userâ€™s session on the server side.
//ðŸ”‘ What it does
//1.Normally, with NextAuth, you use useSession() on the client (React hook).
//2.But sometimes you need the session before rendering a page or handling a server action.
//Thatâ€™s where getServerSession comes in.
//It directly checks the cookies / JWT and gives you the session object without needing a client-side request.

// app/api/example/route.ts
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth"
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options"

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

  if (!session) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
  }

  return new Response(`Hello ${session.user?.email}`)
}
authOptions = your NextAuth configuration (providers, callbacks, etc.)

getServerSession(authOptions) = checks if the request has a valid session cookie.


ðŸš€ When to use it
Protecting API routes â†’ check if a user is logged in.

Server Components (App Router) â†’ pre-fetch session so you can render different UIs based on authentication.

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) â†’ hydrate the page with user data without waiting on the client.
